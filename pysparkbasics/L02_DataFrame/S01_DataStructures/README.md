# Data structures in a data frame
As we know a data frame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure. It has columns and rows. 
Each column must have a type:
- primitive types: int, long, float, double, string, boolean, etc.
- array type
- map type
- struct type
- time type: Date, timestamp, unix_timestamp(long)
